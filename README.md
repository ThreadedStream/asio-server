This repository contains an example of writing a very bad code. This project was conceived during my last college year, and it's been a part of my project portfolio 
since its creation in 2020. I decided not to delete it for two reasons, with the first reason being that i want people to know how bad code actually looks like, whilst the
second reason simply concerns reminiscence.
